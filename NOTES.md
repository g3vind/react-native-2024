# React Native Development Notes

## Dimensions of Component on Screen

- Density Independent Pixels (e.g., `fontSize: 20`)
- Physical Pixels = DIPs \* Scale Factor (of device)
- Window (window & screen) - in Android, the window is smaller than the screen
- Get dimensions: `Dimensions.get("screen")` or `Dimensions.get("window")`

## Detecting Orientation Changes

- In `app.json`: Change "orientation" to "default" to support both landscape and portrait screens
- Hooks: Functions that add extra capabilities to functional components ([React Native Hooks Library](https://github.com/react-native-community/hooks))

### Installing React Native Hooks Library

```bash
npm install @react-native-community/hooks
```
````

- Hooks:
  1. useAccessibilityInfo
  2. useAppState
  3. useBackHandler
  4. useCameraRoll
  5. useClipboard
  6. useDimensions (deprecated, use `useWindowDimensions` instead)
  7. useImageDimensions
  8. useKeyboard
  9. useInteractionManager
  10. useDeviceOrientation
  11. useLayout

### Example Usage:

```jsx
import {
  useWindowDimensions,
  useDeviceOrientation,
} from "@react-native-community/hooks";

// ...

const { width, height, fontScale, scale } = useWindowDimensions();
console.log("Window dimensions:", { width, height, fontScale, scale });

const { landscape } = useDeviceOrientation();
console.log("Device orientation:", landscape ? "landscape" : "portrait");
```

## Flexbox in React Native

- Different from CSS Flexbox
- `flex: 1` grows to take available space
- `SafeAreaView` works better than `View` (especially on Android)

### Example:

```jsx
<>
  <SafeAreaView
    style={{
      flex: 0.5,
      backgroundColor: "dodgerblue",
    }}
  ></SafeAreaView>
  <SafeAreaView
    style={{
      flex: 0.5,
      backgroundColor: "red",
    }}
  ></SafeAreaView>
</>
```
